# 🚀 ECE 383 - Final Project

The final project in this class will be the design and implementation of an engineering prototype to address some need. The final projects in this class are to be completed individually. The following are significant deliverables in the completion of the final project. See [Final Project Document](https://georgeyork.github.io/ECE383_web/lab/final_project/project.html) for more details.

## 📝 Proposal

The proposal describes the need that the project fulfills, and the requirements that should be met in order to satisfy this need. Project specifications may be modified by the instructor.

## 🗺️ Plan

The project plan describes the hardware organization used to realize your design. In addition, it defines the technical accomplishments for the first and second milestones.

## 🛣️ Milestone I

A milestone is an intermediate level of technical accomplishment required in the final system. The first milestone will generally focus on getting the low level units of the design operational.

## 🛣️ Milestone II

The second milestone generally seeks to integrate the units of the design. You should aim to have a simplified version of your design complete.

## 	🧑‍🏫 Presentation

A presentation in front of the class covering the design needs, high level architecture, detailed design, and a demo of the final product.

## 📄 Write-up

A written document describing your design, its performance, and its operation.
