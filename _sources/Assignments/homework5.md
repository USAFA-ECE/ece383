- Draw a detailed diagram of the oscilloscope grid required for Lab1 [Do not try to reuse and edit the picture above]. A detailed
diagram must be drawn on green engineering paper (or draw using a computer program) and include:
-- (x,y) corners of the monitor.
-- (x,y) each of the four major corners (already given), y-coordinates for all the major horizontal grid lines.
-- (x,y) coordinates for one set of three horizontal of hatch marks. Indicate with an arrow which set of three. 
-- x-coordinates for all of the major vertical grid lines.
-- (x,y) coordinates for one set of four vertical of hatch marks. Indicate with an arrow which set of four.

- Given that the pixel clock is running at 25Mhz, add the durations and counts of the h_synch and v_synch signals show in Lab 1.
Set time=0 on the blue dashed line on the left side of the region labeled "Active Video." You should add durations and counts
for all blue lines.
