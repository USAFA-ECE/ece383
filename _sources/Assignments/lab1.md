# ðŸ”¬ Lab 1: VGA Synchronization

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Students should be able to generate a time-critical signal, VGA.

:::{note}
Before software can be reusable, it first has to be usable.

## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

In this lab, you will write a VGA controller in VHDL and implement it on your FPGA development board. You will be provided a VGA-to-HDMI module that will automatically format your output for the HDMI output port on your development board. This VGA controller will be tasked to generate the display portion of an oscilloscope as shown in the figure below. The scope face consists of a white grid, used to measure the signals, two trigger markers, and the waveforms. The grid shall contain 11 vertical lines and 9 horizontal lines. In this lab, the waveforms will be artificially generated by your code, but in later labs, the waveforms will be generated by incoming audio waveforms.

## ðŸšš Deliverables (2 extra points)

### Deliverable 1 
- **[5 Points]** Demo `Program15_1()` to display raw ADC data on the LCD. Note that the distance values on the LCD are not valid at this stage.

### Deliverable 2 
- **[5 Points]** Calibrate your sensors. Submit three plots for your right, center, and left sensors. 

### Deliverable 3 
- **[5 Points]** Demo `Program15_1()` with accurate distances on the LCD. 
Choose three distances (100, 300, and 500 mm) for each sensor and use a ruler in the lab for measurement. You can do a live demo, which is preferred, or provide a video demo. If you choose a video demo, ensure that you **include your voice to clearly state the distances you are testing**.

### Deliverable 4 
- **[5 Points]** Provide a screenshot of the Expressions tab after running `Program15_2()`. Ensure that `left`, `center`, `right`, `result`, `truth`, and `errors` are visible in the Expressions tab. 
- Note that providing a screenshot before running the program will result in a grade of 0.

### Deliverable 5 
- **[5 Points]** Demo `Program15_4()` to display the classifications on the LCD. Ensure you show at least three error cases (enum scenario <= 7) and at least five non-error cases (enum scenario > 7). You can do a live demo, which is preferred, or provide a video demo. If you choose a video demo, **include your voice to clearly state the classifications you are testing**. 

### Deliverable 6 
- **[6.5 Points]**  Ensure that you provide comments in your code for clarity and push your code to your repository using git.
