# ðŸ”¬ Lab 1: VGA Synchronization

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Students should be able to generate a time-critical signal, VGA.

## ðŸ“œ Synopsis

In this lab, you will write a VGA controller in VHDL and implement it on your FPGA development board. You will be provided a VGA-to-HDMI module that will automatically format your output for the HDMI output port on your development board. This VGA controller will be tasked to generate the display portion of an oscilloscope as shown in the figure below. The scope face consists of a white grid, used to measure the signals, two trigger markers, and the waveforms. The grid shall contain 11 vertical lines and 9 horizontal lines. In this lab, the waveforms will be artificially generated by your code, but in later labs, the waveforms will be generated by incoming audio waveforms.

## ðŸ§® Procedure

### ðŸ’» VGA Overview

Video Graphics Array (VGA) is an interface protocol used to transmit analog video data to a screen. The VGA protocol uses a scanning method to project an image on the screen. Starting in the top-left of the screen, the monitor will progressively move from left to right, top to bottom to display each pixel. The following signals must be sent to a VGA monitor in order to display an image.
- `red`, `green`, `blue` - three separate analog voltage signals indicating the amount of each color to display in the current pixel. These signals are sometimes abbreviated as RGB.
- `h_sync` - Horizontal synchronization signal that tells the screen to start writing pixels to the next line
- `v_sync` - Vertical synchronization signal that tells the screen that the current video frame is completed. The screen then starts writing pixels to the top-left of the screen.
  
Both synchronization signals contain four unique states: `active_video`, `front_porch`, `sync_pulse`, and `back_porch`. Incoming pixel data (through the RGB channels) is only displayed during the active_video state of the synchronization signals.

Internally, you will use a 25MHz clock as your `pixel_clk`. On the rising edge of this clock, when both the `h_sync` and `v_sync` signals are in the active_video state, you will place the RGB values you want the screen to display for that pixel. During all other states, the RGB values must be "0".

```
*Figure 1*: The `h_sync` signal contains four states. Pixel data is only displayed on the monitor during the active_video state. During all other state, the RGB values must be "0".

The v_sync signal looks nearly identical to the h_sync signal, however it is significantly stretched out in time. Where the h_sync signal was counted in terms of pixel_clk, the v_sync signal is counted based on iterations of the h_sync signal. For example, in Figure 2, the active_video portion is active for 480 complete iterations of the h_sync signal.

```
*Figure 2*: The v_sync signal is similar to h_sync, but instead of counting based on pixel_clk, the states are based on the number of iterations of the h_sync signal. Pixel data is only displayed on the monitor during the active_video state. During all other state, the RGB values must be "0".

More details on the VGA protocol can be found at http://www-mtl.mit.edu/Courses/6.111/labkit/vga.shtml. This link provides the exact numbers needed to generate the correct timing pulse signals for any VGA resolution. And this youtube video illustrates how the old CRT works: How a TV Works in Slow Motion - The Slow Mo Guys .

### VHDL Code

In order to get you going in this lab, some of the VHDL code has been provided for you. In most cases, you should refrain from changing the modules given. In order to get a better understanding how these modules interact with one another, the following section provides a schematic and the input, output and behavior of some of the modules.
- lab1.vhdl
- lab1.xdc
- video.vhdl
- vga_tb.vhdl
- dvid.vhdl
- tdms.vhdl
- All this code is in this ZIP file: [lab1_cadet_code.zip](https://github.com/USAFA-ECE/ece383/raw/refs/heads/main/book/Assignments/files/lab1_cadet_code.zip)

### Architecture

The design of Lab 1 is broken down into separate modules, some of which are provided for you and some which you will need to create. The interconnection of the modules is illustrated in the following schematic. When a signal name appears just inside a box, that should should correspond to the name of that signal in the entity description. Please note there are a few omissions in the diagram that you should correct as part of your documentation (see Turn-In section).

```
There are two modules which will constitute the majority of your work, VGA and scopeFace. The following two subsections details the behavior of these two modules.

### The VGA module

Your main task is to build the VGA component for Lab1. This component sweeps across the display from left to right, and then return to the left side of the next lower row. The VGA interface determines the color of each pixel on this journey with the help of the scopeFace component.

### The ScopeFace module

Inside the VGA module sits an instance of the scopeFace entity. This entity only contains combinational logic. When given a row,column pair, its responsible for generating the R,G,B value of that pixel.

```
entity scopeFace is
    Port ( row : in  unsigned(9 downto 0);
           column : in  unsigned(9 downto 0);
			  trigger_volt: in unsigned (9 downto 0);
			  trigger_time: in unsigned (9 downto 0);
           r : out  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
           g : out  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
           b : out  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
			  ch1: in std_logic;
			  ch1_enb: in std_logic;
			  ch2: in std_logic;
			  ch2_enb: in std_logic);
end scopeFace;
```
